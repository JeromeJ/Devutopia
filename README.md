Devutopia
=========

Platform that aim to bring the decentralize advantages to the whole world.

Everything will be user-collaborative-able, everyone will be able to add content
without asking and without replacing original content.
Every contribution will be available to the public,
if the publisher wish so. This is not up to the original publisher though.
Original author can then choose to ignore, accept or merge new modifications.

Technical note: Probably wont be really decentralized at first, for the sake of simplicity of dev,
but the goal is to make it really decentralized later. For now, we'd like a quick neat way
to bring a decentralized-like plateform for everybody and every type of content.
